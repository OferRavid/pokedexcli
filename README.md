# Pokedex CLI

A command-line interface (CLI) Pokedex application that interacts with the PokÃ©API to fetch location and PokÃ©mon data. The application supports exploring locations, catching PokÃ©mon, inspecting caught PokÃ©mon, and displaying an in-game Pokedex.

## Features
âœ… Explore location areas and discover PokÃ©mon in them.   
âœ… Catch PokÃ©mon with a simulated capture mechanic.   
âœ… Inspect caught PokÃ©mon to see their stats and attributes.   
âœ… View a list of all caught PokÃ©mon.   
âœ… Navigate through location areas with pagination.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following packages:

### `main` (Root Package)
Handles the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), command processing, and application logic.

- [`main.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/main.go): Initializes the application and starts the REPL.
- [`commands.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/commands.go): Implements the CLI commands.
- [`repl.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/repl.go): Manages the interactive REPL interface.

### `internal/pokeapi`
Interacts with the PokÃ©API to fetch PokÃ©mon and location data.

- [`client.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/internal/pokeapi/client.go): Defines the API client for making HTTP requests and caching responses.
- [`location_types.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/internal/pokeapi/location_types.go): Defines data structures for locations and encounters.
- [`pokemon.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/internal/pokeapi/pokemon.go): Defines data structures for PokÃ©mon details.
- [`pokeapi.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/internal/pokeapi/pokeapi.go): Contains base API URLs and constants.

### `internal/pokecache`
Implements an in-memory cache to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.

- [`pokecache.go`](https://github.com/OferRavid/pokedexcli/blob/main/internal/pokecache/pokecache.go): Defines the Cache struct and its constructor and methods.
